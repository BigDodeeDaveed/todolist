MY FIRST FASTHTML APP (100% of the time i was camping in Google and StackOverflow)
I'm not gonna lie, I barely know how anything works here. The Database connection method is manual connection using sqlite3 library, you just have to go to the database.py file and change the directory 
This program also uses FastHTML and Uvicorn for website contents and hosting. This is a simple To-Do List that makes you add lists and allows you to check them using the button. You can also delete the tasks if you wanted.
Required libraries: FastHTML and Uvicorn maybe other libraries idk I'm too tired
